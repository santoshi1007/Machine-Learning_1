# Machine-Learning_project:Chennai-House-Price-Prediction
a)Real estate transactions are quite opaque sometimes and it may be difficult for a newbie to know the fair price of any given home. Thus, multiple real estate websites have the functionality to predict the prices of houses given different features regarding it. Such forecasting models will help buyers to identify a fair price for the home and also give insights to sellers as to how to build homes that fetch them more money. Chennai house sale price data is shared here and the participants are expected to build a sale price prediction model that will aid the customers to find a fair price for their homes and also help the sellers understand what factors are fetching more money for the houses?

In this project we perform following operations:

1)Data Exploration
2)Data Cleaning
i) Filling missing values
ii) Changing Datatype of columns
iii) Replacing errors while data collection with right values
3)Univariate Analysis
4)Bivariate Analysis
5)Linear Regression 
6)GradientBoostingRegressor 
7)DecisionTreeRegressor 
8)XGBRegressor 
9)RandomForestRegressor 
10)Model Evaluation with RMSLE
